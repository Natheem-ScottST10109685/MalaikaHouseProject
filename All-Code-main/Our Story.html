                    <p>At Malaika House, we believe that every child deserves an education that honors their unique way
                        of learning and being in the world. Our mission is to create inclusive, supportive environments

                        skills they need to thrive.</p>
                    <p>We focus on the heart ‚Äì not just academic achievement, but emotional intelligence, empathy, and
                        the profound connections that make learning meaningful. Our approach recognizes that when
                        children feel truly seen, understood, and valued, their natural curiosity and potential can
                        flourish.</p>
