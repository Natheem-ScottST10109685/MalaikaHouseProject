# All-Code-main — Static Website (Course Project)

This repository contains a static multi-page website (HTML/CSS) created as part of a 3rd-year Work Integrated Learning project. The pages are standalone HTML files and a dashboard folder with admin/parent/external sub-pages.

## What this is

- A collection of static HTML pages representing the site UI (no backend required).
- Intended for local viewing or simple static hosting.
- Files were provided as a code dump from course materials.
